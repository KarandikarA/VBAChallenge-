# VBAChallenge-

For the module 2 chalenge assignment, I heavily relied on two tutoring sessions. The first one was with Limei Hou on Friday at 6:00 pm where she showed me how to properly run an xlxm file. The most importnat tutoring session was on Monday at 1:00 pm with Kourt Bailey. During this tutoring session, I learned how to properly save a vba file and how to upload things to a github respository. I also used the module 2 challenge instructions to help me solve the coding.
